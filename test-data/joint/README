The large GVCF files for NA19625, HG00096 and HG00268 consist of parts of chromosomes 20-21.
These are from the Broad Institutes's Github repository,
https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/master/src/test/resources/large/gvcfs.

The genotyped VCF file was created by running CombineGVCFs and GenotypeGVCFs on the gVCFs, with the
setting --allow-old-rms-mapping-quality-annotation-data.
These were last generated using GATK 4.1.4.1.
